# my_flower_project
Overview of my project:
This project is a breathing tool that individuals can follow that can helkp them rest their breathing pattern. This data visualtion is a coding prototype coded in Javascrip on processing of a ywllow flower that expands and contracts in time with the 4-7-8 breathing technique. The prototype was developed to help anyone in need of resetting their breath in times of anxiety, stress or even in seek of calmess. The projected was created to bring tranquility, help with anxiety, depression and even sleep. The breathing pattern (4-7-8) is a popular technique used by many psycologists and doctors to help manage an increased heart rate.

Over the course, I developed 3 prototypes and using peer feedback decided the final protype (prototype 3) was the most effective in terms of helping pindividuals find solace and tranquility. In the other folders I included all 3 prototypes for you to check out.
