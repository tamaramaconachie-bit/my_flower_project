#BreathOn
This project is a data visualization breathing tool designed to help individuals reset their breathing pattern and achieve a state of relaxation. The tool is built using JavaScript and Processing, featuring a calming yellow flower animation that expands and contracts in sync with the 4-7-8 breathing technique. This prototype serves as a guided experience to promote tranquility and alleviate stress, anxiety, and even sleep disturbances.

The 4-7-8 breathing technique is a widely recognized method often recommended by psychologists and healthcare professionals to help manage elevated heart rates and reduce anxiety. The pattern involves inhaling for 4 seconds, holding the breath for 7 seconds, and exhaling for 8 seconds. This simple yet effective breathing exercise has been shown to activate the parasympathetic nervous system, helping individuals calm their bodies and minds.

This breathing tool was developed to provide users with a visual and interactive way to reset their breath, whether they're dealing with anxiety, stress, or simply seeking a moment of calm. By using the soothing motion of the flower in conjunction with the 4-7-8 technique, users are guided through the breathing process, making it easier to achieve relaxation, lower their heart rate, and improve mental well-being.

The goal of this project is to offer a free and accessible tool for mental wellness, helping individuals cope with daily stressors, manage anxiety, and improve their sleep quality by incorporating a proven relaxation technique into their routine.
